* Get LAS files and deposit them in folder `raw_data`
* Add folder to export generated data in first notebook.

# 20210117
* Provisioning package `welly` as user (`provision-vagrant-user.sh`)
* Add flexible folders for raw data and exported/generated data for all notebooks. Find the project root and then build the paths from there.
* Add shared folder `navarro`
* New branch `navarro` with three notebooks and a data file `LWD_F14.csv`.

# 20210116
*   Fix problem with `jupyter.services` and new versions of Anaconda3 installed by `pyenv`. Add path to pyenv binaries using`Environment=` in the configuration file:

# 20210115-night
* Skip installing deep learning packages
* Comment the lines of the VM name to see if this affects running conda from the shell.
# 20210115-day
* Ignore binary `Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh` for now.
* Machine needs to increase disk size above 10 GB.
* Change Jupyter server port to 8200.
* Install default R from VM terminal. It installs R-3.4.4 with `sudo apt install r-base`. Need to use another repo for `R-3.5.3` or higher.

* Tried to install `Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh` using `pyenv` but it will not work. Cannot install from binary error. `pyenv` only allows a keyword not a binary file as argument.

    ```
    pyenv install Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh    # this will not work
    ```

    

    ```
    config.vm.provision "file", source: "Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh", destination: "/home/vagrant/Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh"
    ```

    

*   Install `plotnine` from script.

*   Installed `tensorflow` and `keras` from provisioning script. Disk space `/dev/sda1 9.7G 6.9G 2.8G 72%`.

*   Install `theano` from the Vagrant provision scripts. Success! Tested with `test_theano.ipynb`.

## TODO
* ~~Increase disk size from 10 GB to 20 GB~~
* Is there a way to execute Jupyter server as user? **Answer**: Yes. But it would be a different configuration. An alternative is `jupyterhub`.
* Why shell commands cannot be executed from Jupyter with `!`? Error `/bin/bash: conda: command not found`. **Answer**: Because `jupyter.service` is lacking the path to jupyter binaries in `~/.pyenv/versions/anaconda3-2020.07`. Adding this to the path using `Environment=` should fix it.
* Should we use `pyenv` to install `conda` environments? **Answer**: Both have different objectives. Although `pyenv` is good at managing Python versions and environments, and also is able to install Anaconda Python versions, if we want the full spectrum of `conda` environment commands, we should stick to `conda`.
